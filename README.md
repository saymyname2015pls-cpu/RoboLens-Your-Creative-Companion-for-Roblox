# RoboLens-Your-Creative-Companion-for-RobloxRoboLens: Your Creative Companion for Roblox


Welcome to RoboLens — not a cheat, not a hack, but a smart assistant for curious Roblox players, builders, and aspiring developers. Designed with respect for fair play and creativity, RoboLens helps you understand, explore, and create — without ever touching live gameplay. 

Whether you’re a 12-year-old building your first obby or a teen learning Lua scripting, RoboLens gives you insight, not advantage. 
🔍 What Can RoboLens Do? 

    Map Explorer (Offline Mode)
    Upload a publicly shared .rbxl file (from Roblox Studio), and RoboLens generates an interactive 3D map with clickable zones: spawn points, checkpoints, secret areas. Perfect for studying level design — no connection to live servers required. 

    Script Analyzer (Read-Only)
    Paste any open-source Lua script (e.g., from a public GitHub repo), and RoboLens explains what it does in plain language:   

        “This script spawns a coin every 5 seconds at position (10, 0, -20).”
        Great for beginners learning game logic — no execution, no injection.  

    Cosmetic Archive Browser
    Browse a community-maintained database of retired or rare Roblox items — with images, release years, and rarity tags. Think of it as a digital museum, not a generator. You can’t equip anything — only admire and learn. 

    Practice Timer & Stats Tracker
    Manually log your session times, wins, or completion attempts in games like Obby or Tycoon. RoboLens visualizes your progress with charts — all data stays on your device. No auto-clicking. No automation. Just honest reflection. 

    Studio Helper (Local Only)
    When you’re building in Roblox Studio, RoboLens can suggest optimal part sizes, lighting setups, or free model sources from the official Toolbox — all within your local environment.
